# Temp Conversion Utility

A no-frills temperarture converion tool (with GUI!), written in Python 3.4.3
Pretty lame tool if you ask me, but be kind, as this is really just a way to learn [Tkinter](https://wiki.python.org/moin/TkInter). 

## Usage 

Run it from a shell with: 
`python temp_conv.py` 

## To do: 

Lots.
